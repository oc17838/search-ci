At the Bristol Archives, we hold over 10,000 historical photographs and
film from the British Empire and Commonwealth Collection. Archives staff
are working to digitise and catalogue the collections in our collections
Management system, Emu.

We wish to make the collections available to the public to search
online, in order to raise awareness and generate interest in the
collections. We would like a project team to build a prototype which
will help our uses (both specialist researchers and non specialist)
browser the collection and search the data in a user friendly and fast
way. 

Our database has an image APi and we can provide .csv files of the raw
data. We are interested in any solutions which open up the database to
researchers in novel ways, but also provide a detailed search option and
are able to represent the hierarchical structure of archives in a tree
view. 

Any solutions to performance of database searches and multimedia
manipulation would be interesting. We also have video and audio
recordings as part of the archive.
